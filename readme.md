A personal ray tracing project, thanks to Peter Shirley's "Ray Tracing in a Weekend".

Depends on 'palette', a personal bitmap writer for Windows. (I will make its repo public soon.)

# Features
 - GPU acceleration (CUDA)
 - Single primitive (spheres)
 - 3 material types (diffuse, metal, dielectric)
 - Camera depth of field

# TODO
 - Triangles
 - Meshes
 - Investigate/Improve ray coherence within warps
 - Display rendering progress in real-time
 - Interactive camera
 - Load scenes from file
 - Volumetric scattering
 - Inhomogenous refractive index
 - SDF geometry
 - Motion blur
 - Emissive materials
 - Directional lights
 - Stratified sampling of rays (blue noise)
 - Importance sampling
 - Movies
